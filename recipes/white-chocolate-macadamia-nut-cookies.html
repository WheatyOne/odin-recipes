        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 1/8 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon cornstarch</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>3/4 cup unsalted butter (melted)</li>
                <li>3/4 cups lightly packed brown sugar</li>
                <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
                <li>1 large egg + 1 egg yolk</li>
                <li>1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
                <li>1 cup white chocolate chips</li>
                <li>1 cup roughly chopped macadamia nuts</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Whisk the flour, cornstarch, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Whisk the melted butter, brown sugar, granulated sugar, egg, egg yolk, and vanilla extract together until combined. Pour into dry ingredients and mix everything together with a rubber spatula until completely combined. Fold in the white chocolate chips and macadamia nuts. (You can use a mixer for this step if needed.)</li>
                <li>Cover and chill the dough in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours and up to 4 days. If chilling for longer than 2 hours, allow to sit at room temperature for at least 20-30 minutes before rolling and baking because the dough will be quite hard.</li>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Roll cookie dough into balls, about 1-1.5 Tablespoons of dough per cookie, and arrange 3 inches apart on the baking sheets. Bake for 12-13 minutes or until lightly browned on the sides. The centers will look soft.</li>
                <li>Remove from the oven and allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
            </ol>
