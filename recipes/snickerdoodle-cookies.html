        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>2 stick unsalted butter (softened)</li>
                <li>1 1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
                <li>1 1/2 teaspoons cream of tartar</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons vanilla</li>
                <h3>Cinnamon-Sugar Mixture</h3>
                <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
                <li>1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350ÂºF.</li>
                <li>In a large mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar for 4-5 minutes until light and fluffy.  Scrape the sides of the bowl and add the eggs and vanilla. Cream for 1-2 minutes longer.</li>
                <li>Stir in flour, cream of tartar, baking soda, and salt, just until combined.</li>
                <li>In a small bowl, stir together sugar and cinnamon.</li>
                <li>If time allows, wrap the dough and let refrigerate for 20-30 minutes.  Roll into small balls until round and smooth.  Drop into the cinnamon-sugar mixture and coat well. Using a spoon, coat for a second time, ensuring the cookie balls are completely covered.  *To make flatter snickerdoodles, press down in the center of the ball before placing in the oven. This helps to keep them from puffing up in the middle. *</li>
                <li>Place on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Bake for 9-11 minutes.  Let cool for several minutes on baking sheet before removing from the pan.</li>
